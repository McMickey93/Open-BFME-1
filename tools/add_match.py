"""Append ONE matched row to targets/game/reverse/functions.csv, safely.

Hand-edited rows have caused LF damage, wrong column counts, and overlapping
claims. This tool validates each claim against the ledger and appends it with
CRLF endings. It removes the source's `// <name> present-unmatched` marker and
checks the bytes with `./build.sh`. It restores the source and ledger when the
build fails. Rows survive without verification only when a caller passes
`--no-verify`.

Usage:
  python3 tools/add_match.py <mangled-name> <target_rva> <target_size> <source> \\
      [--notes TEXT] [--replace-existing] [--no-verify] [--root DIR]

`--replace-existing` safely repoints the symbol's one existing ledger row before
verification.  `--replace-rva` does the same keyed on the ADDRESS instead of the
name, which is the only way to convert a machine byte-dump: a real conversion
changes the name (`?d_000a8940@@YAXXZ` -> `?addr@SpikeAccessor@@QAEPADXZ`), so
--replace-existing cannot find the row it needs to retire. It accepts scaffold
rows at the same range. With identity and boundary evidence, it can also retire
a matched wrong identity when the old range lies inside the corrected full
body. Verification restores the old row if it fails.
`--replace-archive-import OLD_NAME` is a separate verified provider repair:
only an existing vendored archive's six-byte private dispatch thunk, table
field, and independently matched initializer may replace a gen-import row.
