"""Refuse changes that run the conversion direction backward: asm -> C++ only.

Usage:  conversion_gate.py OLD NEW
        OLD/NEW are git revisions; NEW may be ":" for the staged index.

Rule A: added lines under game/ (outside game/gen_small/) may not contain
        __declspec(naked) or _emit/__emit. game/gen_small/ is exempt only
        because it is the frozen output of the retired generators, never
        because a new dump is welcome there; a proven codegen blocker
        (x87, SEH) belongs in game/masm_dumps/*.asm. Eighteen fleet commits
        titled "convert ... to exact C++" deleted real C++ bodies and added
        __emit thunks — byte-verification passes on those, so this is the
        only gate that can see them.

Rule B: a matched RVA that had at least one clean-C++ source in OLD must
        still have one in NEW. Retracting a wrong claim (row deleted or
        status changed) is legal and must be its own commit; repointing a
        live clean claim at a dump is never legal.

Rule C: game/gen_asm/ is machine output and stays that way. C1 every added
        line there must match the grammar the retired generator emitted, so a
        lift of a NAMED function cannot be expressed in the directory at all,
        unless the whole new file is exactly what tools/dump_apply.py writes
        from the old one (symbolic relocations, re-derived here, not trusted); C2 every added
        ledger row pointing there is anonymous (?d_<rva>@@YAXXZ, notes
        gen-dump), so a dump can never squat an identity byte-verification
        cannot falsify; C3 a wave commit may not touch any other file under
        game/, so a deleted C++ body cannot ride inside a diff of 33,000
        unreadable `db` lines. Rule A needs no exemption here and gets none:
        a `db` dump matches neither NAKED_RE nor LIFT_RE, and source_kind
        scores a .asm file as assembly unconditionally, so the offence Rule A
        polices -- inflating the C++ lane with re-encoded binary -- is not
        expressible in this directory.

# Every __emit counts, whatever its operand (owner verdict 2026-10-13;
# adversarial review round 2): a literal is its byte value; a #define, enum or
# `const` integral constant with a literal initializer resolves to its value
# (same file, or a tracked game/ header); anything else is counted as its own
# symbol (operand text plus its definition, so a changed definition is
# growth). Emit macros are expanded to a fixpoint: a macro is an emit macro if
# its body names __emit/_emit or another emit macro, and a function-like one
# has its arguments substituted, so `EB(0x90)` -> `EB(0xC3)` is a new byte.
# Emit macros and constants are also collected from every tracked game/ header
# (outside game/gen_small/) and every tracked file under inputs/reference/shims/
# (authored, edited often; any extension) that defines one, at the revision
# being compared; the rest of inputs/reference/ (the vendored EA tree, nine
# files with __emit upstream) is not followed. A name defined more than once
# is an emit macro if ANY definition emits (fail closed: the gate cannot tell
# which header or #ifdef branch a TU sees), and identical duplicate constant
# definitions count once.
# A renamed function's emits count as new (conservative: the gate cannot tell
# a rename from a move, G2 note 8).

# Outside headers (approved 2026-10-14, CR2B H1): emit macros and raw emit
# bodies outside game/ and inputs/reference/shims/ (inputs/vendor/, the
# vendored EA tree, the rest of inputs/) are never judged where they are
# written. An "emit file" is an outside file that defines an emit macro or
# holds a literal __emit/_emit outside comments, strings and char literals.
# - Rule A3 refuses an include a game/ or shims file adds (an #include line,
#   or a `// cl:` /FI) that resolves to an emit file or to an outside file
#   that includes one. An added, changed or removed `// cl:` or `// stlport`
#   line re-judges that file's includes; one that reached the same emit
#   files before is not blamed again.
# - Rule A6 refuses a symlink (mode 120000) under game/ or shims: the gate
#   reads a link as its target text and cannot resolve through it.
# - Rule A5 refuses a diff after which the emit files reached from the
#   existing includes of game/ and shims files (R) hold one they did not:
#   the macro or raw-body flip of an included file, reach growing behind an
#   existing include, an emit file moved into reach. A vendor import that
#   nothing in game/ reaches passes.
# - The #define lines of every outside emit macro (and of outside macros
#   naming one) join header_prelude, so a NEW use in game/ is emit growth
#   like any header macro's, while a re-shown or moved use is not.
# Includes resolve the way build.py runs cl.exe: a quoted include first looks
# next to the including file, then every include tries the `// cl:` /I dirs
# in order, then INCLUDE (the STLport overlay, stlport and stlport/src for a
# `// stlport` file, nbench for Benchmark/, then Vc7/include). A header with
# no `// cl:` line, and every outside file, falls back to a path-suffix match
# against the outside tree after the quoted-sibling check. The suffix match
# is a guess, not a proof: it can send an include to the wrong outside file
# (the EA debug/_pch.h's "internal.h" once matched profile/internal.h), so it
# can refuse wrongly as well as miss; a wrong refusal goes on the shrink-only
# allowlist below. Names are normalised (posixpath.normpath, `\` -> `/`) and
# compared without case, as on Windows. A3 and A5 run only when the diff
# touches an outside inputs/ path, deletes or renames a game/ or shims file,
# or changes an #include, `// cl:` or `// stlport` line. The outside scan is
